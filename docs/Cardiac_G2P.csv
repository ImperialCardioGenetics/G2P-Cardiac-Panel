Although the evidence for this association is not definitive, available data suggests that disease is likely due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence. The main evidence for autosomal dominant CASQ2 association comes from an international multi-centre study describing CPVT patients with CASQ2 variants (Ng et al, 2020, PMID:32693635). This study included 12 probands with heterozygous variants in CASQ2, as well as an assessment of heterozygous relatives of probands with homozygous/compound heterozygous CASQ2 variants (8/37 of these heterozygous relatives had a positive CPVT phenotype). While this study provides a substantive body of evidence to support autosomal dominant CASQ2 association with CPVT, the data should be cautiously interpreted. The multi-centre nature of the study precluded standardised phenotyping of the probands and relatives and therefore not every phenotype-positive individual may have a definitive diagnosis of CPVT. Additionally, several of the variants described have a gnomAD population minor allele frequency that is incompatible with being a penetrant autosomal dominant variant for a disease with the prevalence of CPVT (>1x10-5).

Cardiac involvement can be the presenting feature, even without recognised syndromic features, fulfilling a clinical diagnosis of HCM. The mechanism of autosomal dominant disease is likely a dominant-negative effect of protein-altering variants leading to abnormal intermediate filament aggregation. The autosomal recessive phenotype has been associated with an earlier age of onset, and has been linked with combinations of protein-altering variants and/or null variants. It has been suggested that biallelic loss of function leads to the autosomal recessive phenotype, indicating a distinct mechanism of disease to the dominant phenotype. The heterozygous parents of patients with the recessive phenotype are reported as being clinically unaffected, suggesting that heterozygous loss of function is tolerated.","DES-related myofibrillar myopathy is typically inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. Penetrance is incomplete with age-related onset, but simplex cases have often been found to be due to de novo heterozygous variants rather than recessive variants. Over 100 different variants have been reported, including missense variants, in-frame indels, and splice-site variants leading to exon skipping.<br/> There is evidence for a possible genotype-phenotype correlation for heterozygous DES variants, with variants located in specific domains more likely to cause either a neurological or cardiac phenotype.<br/> There is a wide range of cardiac phenotypes associated with DES, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, and left-ventricular non-compaction.

Missense variants are more prevalent, and are responsible for a larger proportion of DCM cases, but truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift, and splice variants) are also associated with disease, most probably through loss of function mechanisms. Single and multi-exon deletions have also been reported.<br/> LMNA has a ClinGen Dosage sensitivity score of 2, indicating there is some evidence for dosage pathogenicity. Non-missense variants are reported to convey a higher risk of life-threatening arrhythmia (PMID: 31155932).<br/><br/> LMNA-related DCM is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and disease is generally a highly penetrant and aggressive arrhythmogenic phenotype with high rates of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. LMNA missense and truncating variants account for ~5-8% of genetic DCM.<br/><br/> Of note LMNA is also associated with several other conditions (the laminopathies) including muscular dystrophies and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria. Some of these conditions are autosomal recessive and some dominant. There is evidence of clustering of variants to specific regions of the gene. However, DCM causing variants have been recorded across the gene and are so far all reported with dominant inheritance.","frameshift_variant;missense_variant;stop_gained_NMD_triggering;splice_donor_variant_NMD_triggering;splice_acceptor_variant_NMD_triggering;exon_loss_variant","11897440;20127487;29367541;28912180;10662742;12854972;10580070;31983221;18926329;29095976;12920062","MONDO:0007269","30.03.2021","08.12.2021","Cardiomyopathy expert panel","Heart/Cardiovasculature/Lymphatic","Cardiac","LMNL1;PRO1;LGMD1B;LMN1;CMD1A","6636","2022-04-25T12:45:00Z"

QT prolongation was observed in 5 out of 12 carriers of the variant. Evidence of LVH was observed in 4 out of 11 carriers who underwent echocardiogram. No specific mechanism of disease causation was suggested. Studies in transgenic mouse models have suggested a link with cardiac hypertrophy, but only in biallelic knockout mice. In summary, there is a single report linking the p.His246Arg variant in MYO6 with a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype exhibiting incomplete penetrance (Mohiddin et al. 2004, PMID: 15060111). The authors note that they were unable to definitively rule out an alternative cause for the cardiac phenotype in the family.

The G2P team have assigned the relationship between MYO6 and hearing loss and LVH as moderate to ensure that variants in this gene are at least considered in a patient presenting with hearing loss and LVH. Our literature search did not identify cases presenting with isolated LVH.","There is evidence from multiple reports that protein truncating and missense variants in MYO6 are associated with autosomal dominant progressive hearing loss. Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity is associated with congenital hearing loss, suggesting a dose-dependent mechanism. ClinGen classified the relationship between MYO6 and hearing loss as Definitive. The relationship for hearing loss and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was not classified separately as there wasn't evidence of a distinct mechanism for the two phenotypes. Overall the evidence for cardiac involvement is limited. <br/><br/> Mohiddin et al. (2004, PMID: 15060111) reported a family with autosomal dominant hearing loss who were initially ascertained due to the proband presenting with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Linkage studies implicated the region containing MYO6, and a missense variant was identified (p.His246Arg) and segregated with disease (with the exception of one individual who was negative for the variant but described as a double phenocopy with presbycusis and cardiac abnormalities consistent with valvar and ischaemic disease).
